    "### Analytical Report (~230 words)\n",
    "The roll-up analysis of total sales by country and quarter highlights a pronounced concentration of revenue in a small number of geographies. Typically, the United Kingdom emerges as the dominant contributor (consistent with the original Online Retail dataset’s business context), while a long tail of countries contributes modest incremental volume. Quarter-to-quarter variance tends to be smoother in the larger markets, suggesting relatively stable demand, whereas smaller countries display higher proportional volatility—an expected pattern when baseline volumes are low. This volatility can inform differentiated forecasting strategies: exponential smoothing with stronger regularization for minor markets, versus finer seasonal decomposition for major ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drill-down on the selected country (e.g., United Kingdom) reveals monthly seasonality—often with noticeable peaks aligned to pre‑holiday periods—underscoring opportunities for targeted promotional planning. Identifying months with soft performance year‑over‑year can guide remedial marketing or inventory reallocation decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slice on the inferred 'Electronics' category shows that, under a simple keyword-based classification, electronics represent only a relatively small fraction of total sales. Because this categorization is heuristic (string keyword search) rather than derived from a governed product master, the absolute figures should be treated as indicative rather than authoritative. Nevertheless, even a coarse category signal enables rapid margin or return-rate diagnostics once integrated with cost or refund data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the warehouse schema (separate Time and Customer dimensions with a clean transactional fact) accelerates iterative OLAP: analysts can pivot across geography, period, and ad‑hoc product groupings without restructuring source extracts. This design directly supports strategic planning (geographic expansion focus), operational tuning (inventory scaling ahead of seasonal peaks), and tactical marketing (country‑specific month campaigns)."
